# es6-pixi-bolierplate

Rock Paper Scissors game made with Pixi.js using ES6/2015.

## Usage

First of all, this project needs [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) in the global scope:

```js
npm install webpack -g
```

Once we have installed webpack just clone this repository:

```js
git clone https://github.com/thetomasgames/rockPaperScissors
```

And install it:

```js
npm install
```

Now you can use `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start watching and compiling files, or `npm run build` to create a minified, ready to production file.
